# Hotel Management System (Modified Version)

This is a **web-based hotel management system** that I customized and enhanced from an existing open-source project.  
The system provides a streamlined way for hotels to manage bookings, rooms, invoices, and customer interactions.


## Key Features Added 
1. **Form Validation**  
   - Improved input validation across the system to ensure data accuracy and prevent errors.

2. **Updated Images & Database**  
   - Refreshed hotel images for a modern look.  
   - Modified database schema to support new features and improve reliability.

3. **Invoice Download (Excel Format)**  
   - Customers and admins can now download invoices directly in Excel format for easy record-keeping.

4. **Room Categorization**  
   - Instead of showing only the total number of rooms available, the system now displays availability by category (e.g., Superior, Deluxe, Single).

5. **Customer Reviews**  
   - Added a review section where clients can leave feedback about their stay.

6. **Hotel Location Map**  
   - Integrated a map view so customers can easily see the hotel’s location.

7. **Admin Reports**  
   - Admins can generate and download reports showing:  
     - Profitability  
     - Most booked room categories  
     - Overall booking trends

8. **Flexible Checkout**  
   - Customers can now check out on any day they choose, improving flexibility.
